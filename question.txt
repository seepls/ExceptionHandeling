Exceptions is distrupt normal flow of execution 
exceptions are handled using : try , catch , finally 

try : has all the code to be monitored 
catch: catches exception in try 
finally : always executed

error : caused by environment in which application running 
eg : out of memory 

we should not write any other statement between try,catch and finally block .

we cannot just write try : shows compilation error 
try must appear in pair with either catch or finally 

once try block throws exception remaining statements not executed 

when we keep multiple catch : keep from most specific to most general 
if you keep super class before subclass it shows the general one 
Java.lang.Error: super class of all types of errors in JAVA 
Java.lang.Exception : throwable object : error or exception 

Run time exception is unknown to compiler 


throw keyword :: can throw exception manually using throw keyword 

throwable : superclass of all errors and exception in java 
only object of this class can throw
